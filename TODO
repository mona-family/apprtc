- To get it running for now:
  docker run -p 8089:8089 -it collider
  docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8000:8000 -it apprtc

  Surf to: http://localhost:8080/?wstls=false

- Get rid of "max 2 people in room" limit
  => This really seems "built in", in collider as well. Not sure if it will be easy to work around

- Can we get the analytics to work?
    - See README.md, you'll have to run a bootstrap (manually?)
    -> Seems like these analytics don't do much, so most of it would still have to be implemented by us.
        Note: they are part of AppRTC, not Collider, so we might be better off implementing our own analytics in collider instead by linking collider with our Firebase database.

- Would probably be easiest to set this up on a Kubernetes cluster because we can then
    rely on existing things (cert-manager for TLS, nginx ingress, ...)

    Alternatively, we could use a docker stack, but I really prefer kubernetes and think I can get it set up
      quicker (especially if we need any authentication later). To check with Klaas.

- Get STUN / TURN working (currently will probably only work when peers are on same network - untested)
  -> Probably need to set up our own servers (using coturn)
