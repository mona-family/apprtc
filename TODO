- To get it running for now:
  docker run -p 8089:8089 -it collider
  docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8000:8000 -it apprtc

  Surf to: http://localhost:8080/?wstls=false

- Is the dev server good enough for us?
    - Can it be made secure enough?
    - Is it able to store stuff? It doesn't have a datastore? Though things seem to persist for now, even between docker restarts. Where is this stored?

- Get STUN / TURN working (currently will only work when peers are on same network)
